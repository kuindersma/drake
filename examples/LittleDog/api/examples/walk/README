This is a simple kinematic walking appliation.  It shows
how to use that minimal set of LittleDog calls from
a UI based on the Qt UI framework.

To build this application, use qmake and make.  The following
environment variables must be set correctly for the build
to work:

	export QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt-3.3
	export LITTLEDOG=(location of LittleDog software install)

Then use the following commands:

	$ qmake walk.pro
	$ make

The qmake command creates a Makefile.  Edit the file
walk.pro to add or remove files, add additional include
directories, etc.
