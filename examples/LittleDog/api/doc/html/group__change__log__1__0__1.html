Changes</a></h2>
This section describes all API and user-visible changes between <a class="el" href="classLittleDog.html">LittleDog</a> release 1.0.0 and <a class="el" href="classLittleDog.html">LittleDog</a> release 1.0.1.<h3><a class="anchor" name="user_guide">
LittleDog_User_Guide</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The kinematic joint offsets table (Table 1., pg 31) has been corrected.</li><li>Erroneous "is_overcurrent" flag documentation has been removed.</li><li>Documentation for abortConnection() has been updated. See <a class="el" href="classLittleDog.html">LittleDog</a> changes below for the details.</li></ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="little_dog">
LittleDog</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Increased the <a class="el" href="classLittleDog.html">LittleDog</a> software version number to 1.0.1</li><li>Added more documentation to <a class="el" href="littledog_8h.html">littledog.h</a></li><li>Fixed a bug in computeFootFK() where it failed to fully populate the orientation vector output</li><li>Increased the amount of error checking in several functions. It is more important in 1.0.1 for users to check error codes than it is in 1.0.0. For instance, the provided walk example needed to have its call to setLegCommandMode() relocated after its call to setJointServoType() in order to avoid errors. As another case in point, internally, our calibration software has been modified to always call setLegCommandMode() because the leg command modes can be changed by users.</li><li>Moved all get*() functions out of the protected scope of <a class="el" href="classLittleDog.html">LittleDog</a> and into the public scope. Additionally, these functions can now be called if the application is connected to the robot (previously, the application had to also be running a trial before it could use any of these types of functions).</li><li>AbortConnection() is no longer a terminating state change. Users may now repeatedly abort and connect to the Robot. The API documentation has been changed to reflect this.</li><li>Converted primary communications from TCP/IP to UDP/IP to ease communication issues where excessive packets are lost</li><li>Enhanced connect/reconnect communications logic</li><li>Added the convenience function getFootPosition(). See class documentation.</li><li>Added the function getPacketLoss(). See class documentation.</li></ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="reader">
LittleDogDataSetFileReader</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Documentation for the constuctor was added</li><li>Reading a dataset can now occur even if the bdi_rt.cfg file can't be found</li></ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="writer1">
LittleDogDataSetFileWriter</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Documentation for the constuctor was added</li><li>The constructor argument sample_duration_in_seconds has been removed. A duration of 0.01 sec. is now passed in internally.</li><li>save() will now delete all files having the filename pased in prior to writing the new dataset to disk</li><li>Writing a dataset can now occur even if the bdi_rt.cfg file can't be found</li></ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="writer2">
LittleDogDataSetFileStreamWriter</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>This new dataset writing class streams data samples to the file as they are recorded instead of accumulating them in memory. This technique should improve the performance of dataset generation and lessen memory usage.</li><li>The class uses a new bdu class named <a class="el" href="classbduDataSetFileStreamWriter.html">bduDataSetFileStreamWriter</a></li></ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="ref_gui_view">
OverheadViewWidget</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>This is a new class for 2D drawing in the reference_ui</li><li>The class is documented in LittleDogUI.h (also, see changes to LittleDogUI mentioned below)</li></ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="ref_gui_ui">
LittleDogUI</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Added an "Abort Connection" button and resized the "Stop Robot" button. Users may now connect and abort communications as needed.</li><li>Added units (e.g. V for volts) to all LCD graphics</li><li>Added a Packet Loss percentage LCD graphic showing the percent loss of UDP packets during the last second</li><li>Uses the new OverheadViewWidget class to draw the position of the robot when connected to the motion capture system. If users desire seeing some examples of how to use this new class, consider enabling the DRAW_FAKE_DESIRED_DATA macro in file examples/walk/MyLittleDogUI.cpp.</li></ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="basic_example">
Basic example</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The handle_result() software in main.cpp has been revised. Users having software that is similar to handle_result() should consider adopting these revisions themselves. The first change is that if this function calls exit() it must invoke "dog's" destructor prior to exiting. The flag "exit_on_error" must therefore be used with care. It is important that the <a class="el" href="classLittleDog.html">LittleDog</a> destructor be called prior to exit() because the it manages all of the shutdown timing. By not deleting <a class="el" href="classLittleDog.html">LittleDog</a> before calling exit(), race conditions will likey result, and the program may crash. However, users may not invoke the destructor in the middle of blocking functions like runTrial() or calibrate(). The second change is that function signal_handler() previously called handle_result() with "true" for argument exit_on_error. This can also causes race conditions because the signal handler may be invoked at any time. "false" is now passed in.</li></ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="walk_example">
KinematicWalker example</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Converted the dataset writer to use a Streamed writer. See the new <a class="el" href="classLittleDogDataSetFileStreamWriter.html">LittleDogDataSetFileStreamWriter</a> class.</li><li>Walking was tuned a bit. The walk no longer falls under gravity during the sway and is in stance with all feet during a brief portion of the cycle. </li></ul>
