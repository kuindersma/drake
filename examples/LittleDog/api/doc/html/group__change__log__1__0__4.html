Changes</a></h2>
This section describes all API and user-visible changes between LittleDog release 1.0.3 and LittleDog release 1.0.4.<h3><a class="anchor" name="little_dog">
LittleDog</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <a class="el" href="classLittleDog.html">LittleDog</a> software version number was increased from 1.0.3 to 1.0.4.</li><li>A bug in the leg inverse kinematics has been resolved. This bug resulted in unreachable joint angles being specified if you attempted to raise a foot above the z=0 plane (body center). This impacted both the kinematics API and the servoFootPosition(). Note that due to the kinematics of the robot there will be a discontinuity in hip rx motion when a foot passes through the z = 0 plane.</li><li>The state machine was changed by removing STATE_MOCAP_INITIALIZED. Users are now free to call initializeMocap() and stopMocap() at almost any time during robot setup and initialization. Refer to the documentation in <a class="el" href="classLittleDog.html">LittleDog</a> for details.</li><li>The stopMocap() method was added. See class documentation of <a class="el" href="classLittleDog.html">LittleDog</a> for details.</li><li>Documentation of what a "typical session" is like has been updated.</li><li>A new model named "littledog_body" is now supported. Users can modify their value for user.vicon.modelname in their bdi_rt.cfg file located in $LITTLEDOG/config and change it from "littledog" to "littledog_body" if they wish to receive only the "trunk" body from the MoCap system. Other MoCap body data will then not be sent to <a class="el" href="classLittleDog.html">LittleDog</a>. It is also advisable to remove or conceil the leg reflective markers the littledog_body model is used. Note that the new model file (littledog_body.vsk) must be placed in the correct location on the Vicon system in order for this to work. Users can find this file in the 1.0.4 distribution in directory \LittleDogAPI_1_0_4\vicon_files. It should be placed into the Vicon session directory that you are currently operating in, along side the other Vicon skeleton files (*.vsk), such as littledog.vsk.</li><li>A new API method called getMocapModelName() is now available. It returns the value found in the bdi_rt.cfg file for user.vicon.modelname. See class documentation for details.</li></ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="vicon">
Vicon Configuration</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you plan to take advantage of the optional littledog_body model mentioned in the previous section ("LittleDog"), you will need to copy the new *.vsk file as described onto your MoCap computer into the Vicon system session directory. Once this is done, users can restart the Vicon iQ software system and choose whether "littledog" or "littledog_body" is checked as an active object in the Vicon Window (under Available Objects). It is critical that only one model is active. As before the activation or deactivation of Vicon objects should not occur while the <a class="el" href="classLittleDog.html">LittleDog</a> API is connected to the Vicon system.</li></ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="little_dog_ui">
LittleDogUI</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The reference_ui has been modified to account for the deleted STATE_MOCAP_INITIALIZED state.</li><li>The "MOCAP INITIALIZED" state block indicator was relocated and converted into a "Mocap Initialized" checkbox indicator.</li><li>The existing "Connect to Mocap" push button was relocated.</li><li>A new "Disconnect from Mocap" push button was added.</li><li>Checkboxes have been modified so that they are never grayed out. This should make it easier to read their text.</li></ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="walk_example">
KinematicWalker example</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Local virtual function MyLittleDogUI::slot_update_overhead_view() has been changed. It now conditionally draws the feet (and 'x' marks) depending on whether the configured MoCap modelname is "littledog_body" or "littledog". </li></ul>
